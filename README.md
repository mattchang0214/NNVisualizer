# NNVisualizer

A work in progress... <https://mattchang0214.github.io/NNVisualizer/>

An educational platform inspired by Tensorflow Playground.

### Planned Updates:
- ~~Print out a table of a few predicted samples~~
- Add more tuning options - learning rate, batch size, etc
- Add regression example
- Refactor: chart as separate module -- matplotlib style syntax
